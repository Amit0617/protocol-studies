# Ethereum Overview

## Peer-to-peer computing

The concept of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, where computers communicate and share resources directly without a central authority, has a rich history dating back to the 1960s. Pioneering projects like the ARPANET project (1966), the first wide-area packet-switched network, laid the groundwork for this decentralized approach. ARPANET demonstrated the model of distributed communication, where "every participating node could request and serve content".

This decentralized philosophy gained significant traction in the late 1990s with the rise of file-sharing platforms like Napster (1999). These platforms challenged the traditional client-server model, where users relied on a central server to access data. Napster, and subsequent platforms like BitTorrent (2001), sparked new conversations and philosophies highlighting the potential for a more democratic and distributed online interaction.
