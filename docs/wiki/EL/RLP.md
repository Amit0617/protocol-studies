# Recursive-Length Prefix (RLP) Serialization

## Overview

Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) is a core serialization protocol used within the Ethereum network to encode data. It is designed to serialize structured data, encompassing everything from transaction data to the entire state of the blockchain. This wiki page explores the internals of RLP, its encoding/decoding rules, tools available and its role in Ethereum's functionality.
