# Recursive-Length Prefix (RLP) Serialization

## Overview

Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) is a core serialization protocol used within the Ethereum network to encode data. It is designed to serialize structured data, encompassing everything from transaction data to the entire state of the blockchain. This wiki page explores the internals of RLP, its encoding/decoding rules, tools available and its role in Ethereum's functionality.

Data serialization is the process of converting data structures or objects into a byte stream for storage, transmission, or later reconstruction. In distributed systems like Ethereum, serialization is crucial for transmitting data across network nodes reliably and efficiently. While common serialization formats include JSON and XML, Ethereum uses RLP due to its simplicity and effectiveness in encoding nested arrays of bytes.
